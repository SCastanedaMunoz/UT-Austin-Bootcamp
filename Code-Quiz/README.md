# Code-Quiz

For this Code Quiz Game I decided to use as little hard coded html elements as possible and start only by having an empty bootstrap container where I would be able to add anything I desired. My goal was to create the whole application in just 1 html file while using JQuery as much as possible to take full advantage of its capabilities. For this I brokew down in different states, Initial, Questioning, Submitting Score, and Leaderboard, which represent every single section the user can encounter in the app. Each state has its own function to reset the page to an empty state and create the corresponding elements for such app state. This also allowed me to have proper tracking when knowing which was the last user state in the app and have a proper app cycle.
